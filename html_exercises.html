     <div><h3>Here's what I like about lists:</h3>
     <ul>  
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>When you make a list, do it in this order:</h3>
     <ol>
         <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
         <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
         <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
         <ul>
             <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
         </ul>
         <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
     </ol>
    </div>
